**4\. Can I submit my own design file?**

Yes, absolutely. Suppose you’ve already created a design using Adobe Illustrator or any other design software. In that case, you can upload your dieline directly through our website. Our design team reviews every file carefully for print accuracy, bleed areas, and resolution. If we notice anything that might affect print quality, we’ll reach out before production starts. This ensures your custom boxes look exactly how you imagined: sharp, clean, and professional.

**5\. Will I receive a proof before production?**

Yes, you’ll always receive a digital proof before we print anything. Within 24 hours of placing your order, our prepress team will send you a 2D preview showing your final box layout. You can review every detail, logo placement, color alignment, and text spacing before giving approval. Once you’re fully satisfied, production begins. This step ensures your custom packaging boxes are printed perfectly the first time.

**6\. How long will my order take?**

Most standard orders take about 10 business days for production after proof approval. Rush orders can be completed in around 7 business days.

**7\. Can you print inside the boxes, too?**

Yes, we can print both inside and outside of your custom packaging boxes. Inside printing creates a great unboxing experience and adds an extra touch of creativity. You can print brand messages, patterns, or product instructions on the interior panels. It’s perfect for brands that want customers to feel something special when opening their package. Our team can help you design both sides for a seamless, branded look.

**8\. How can I be sure my artwork is printable?**

Before printing, our expert prepress team reviews your artwork carefully. We check image resolution, color setup, alignment, and bleed areas to make sure every design prints clearly. If we spot any issues that might reduce print quality, we’ll contact you with suggestions. You’ll get a digital proof to approve before anything goes to print, ensuring your custom boxes look professional and match your brand colors perfectly.

**9\. What factors affect my box pricing?**

The main factors that affect pricing include your box size, material type, ink coverage, and order quantity. Larger boxes or full-color prints may cost slightly more, while bulk orders often qualify for lower unit pricing. We also consider any custom add-ons like foil, embossing, or lamination. At BoxyPack, we’re transparent about all pricing. You can get an instant estimate online or contact us for a tailored quote.
